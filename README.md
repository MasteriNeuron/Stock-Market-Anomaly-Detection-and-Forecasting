Project Objective 🎯
This project analyzes NVIDIA (NVDA) stock data to detect anomalies and forecast prices, combining anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, LOF) with forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX).
Key Goals

🕵️‍♂️ Identify anomalies: Point, contextual, and collective.
🤖 Apply ML for anomaly detection: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, LOF.
📈 Preprocess and decompose time series: Trend, seasonality, residuals.
✅ Ensure stationarity: ADF tests, ACF/PACF analysis.
📅 Forecast prices: Evaluate AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX.
📊 Visualize anomalies and forecasts for actionable insights.

Understanding Time Series and Its Components 📊

Time Series Data: Sequential observations with temporal patterns (trends, seasonality, autocorrelation).
Non-Time Series Data: Observations without temporal order.

Components

📈 Trend: Long-term direction.
🔄 Seasonality: Recurring patterns.
🌊 Cyclical Patterns: Long-term oscillations.
⚡️ Noise: Random fluctuations.

Understanding Anomalies in Time Series Data ⚠️

Point Anomalies: Isolated outliers (e.g., sudden price spikes).
Contextual Anomalies: Outliers in specific contexts (e.g., intraday irregularities).
Collective Anomalies: Unusual group patterns (e.g., volume surges).

Handling of Anomalies in Time Series Data 🛠️

Detection:
ML: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
Statistical: Z-score, IQR rule.


Imputation: Replace outliers with rolling medians for smoother series.

Stationary & Non-Stationary Time Series 🔍

Stationary: Constant mean, variance, autocorrelation.
Non-Stationary: Varying mean, variance, or autocorrelation.

Testing Methods

👀 Visual inspection of rolling statistics.
📉 Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
🔬 KPSS test.
📊 Variance Ratio test.

Conversion Methods 🔄

➖ Differencing: Removes trends.
📏 Log Transformation: Stabilizes variance.
🔄 Seasonal Adjustment: Eliminates seasonal effects.
🛠️ Combination: Sequential transformations for complex data.

Future Enhancements 🌟

🚀 Advanced Models: XGBoost, LSTM, or Transformers for forecasting.
📡 Feature Expansion: Add sentiment analysis (news, X posts) and macroeconomic indicators.
⚡️ Real-Time Detection: Stream intraday data for online anomaly detection.
🔧 Tuning: Use time-series cross-validation and Bayesian optimization.
📬 Automation: Deploy as a Flask/FastAPI service with anomaly alerts.
📊 Backtesting: Evaluate trading strategies with Sharpe ratio and drawdown metrics.

Conclusion 🏁
This project establishes a robust pipeline for NVIDIA stock analysis, effectively detecting anomalies and forecasting prices using statistical and ML methods. ARIMA(1,1,0) delivers reliable short-term predictions, while anomaly detection enhances trading insights. Future enhancements, including advanced models and real-time deployment, promise to further elevate its practical impact in stock market applications.
